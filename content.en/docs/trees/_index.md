# Chapter 7: Trees

> Trees Of Herbs, Shrubs and Bushes

## Why This Chapter Matters?

Nature is man's best teacher. In every walk of life man has explored nature, learnt his lessons and then applied the knowledge that nature offered him to solve every-day problems that he faced at workplace. It isn't without reason that there are data structures like Trees, Binary Trees, Search Trees, AVL Trees, Forests, etc. Trees are non-linear data structures. They have many applications in Computer Science, hence you must understand them.

---

If large input data is stored in a linked list, then time required to access the data is prohibitive. In such cases a data structure called **Tree** is used. This data structure is often used in constructing the file systems and evaluation of arithmetic expressions. This data structure gives a running time of **O(log n)** for most operations.

Like linked lists, a tree also consists of several nodes. Each node may contain links that point to other nodes in the tree. So a tree can be used to represent a person and all of his descendants as shown in Figure 7-1.

![Figure 7-1: A tree structure](image-placeholder)

Note that each node in this tree contains a name for data and one or more pointers to the other tree nodes. Although a tree may contain any number of pointers to the other tree nodes, a large number have at the most two pointers to the other tree nodes. Such trees are called **Binary trees**.

## Binary Trees

Let us begin our study of binary trees by discussing some basic concepts and terminology.

A **binary tree** is a finite set of elements that is either empty or is partitioned into three disjoint sub-sets. The first sub-set contains a single element called the **root** of the tree. The other two sub-sets are themselves binary trees, called the **left and right sub-trees** of the original tree. A left or right sub-tree can be empty.

Each element of a binary tree is called a **node** of the tree. The tree shown in Figure 7-2(a) consists of nine nodes with A as its root. Its left sub-tree is rooted at B and its right sub-tree is rooted at C. This is indicated by the two branches emanating from A to B on the left and to C on the right. The absence of a branch indicates an empty sub-tree. For example, the left sub-tree of the binary tree rooted at C and the right sub-tree of the binary tree rooted at E are both empty. The binary trees rooted at D, G, H and I have empty right and left sub-trees.

Figure 7-2(b) illustrates a structure that is **not** a binary tree.

![Figure 7-2: Binary tree](image-placeholder)

### Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Parent, Child** | If A is the root of a binary tree and B is the root of its left or right sub-tree then, A is parent of B and B is left or right child of A. |
| **Leaf** | A node that has no children (such as D, G, H, or I in Figure 7-2(a)) is called a leaf. |
| **Ancestor, Descendant** | Any node n1 is an ancestor of node n2 (and n2 is a descendant of n1) if n1 is either the parent of n2 or the parent of some ancestor of n2. For example, in the tree shown in Figure 7-2(a), A is an ancestor of C. |
| **Climbing, Descending** | The root of the tree is at the top and the leaves at the bottom. Going from the leaves to the root is called climbing the tree, and going from the root to the leaves is called descending the tree. |
| **Degree of a node** | The number of nodes connected to a particular node is called the degree of a particular node. For example, in Figure 7-2(a) the node B has a degree 3. The degree of a leaf node is always one. |
| **Level** | The root of the tree has level 0. Level of any other node in the tree is one more than the level of its parent. For example, in the binary tree shown in Figure 7-2(a), node E is at level 2 and node H is at level 3. |
| **Depth** | Depth of a node is the maximum number of links from root to that node. The depth of a binary tree is the maximum level of any leaf in the tree. This equals the length of the longest path from the root to any leaf. Thus, the depth of the tree shown in Figure 7-2(a) is 3. |
| **Height** | Height of a node is the maximum number of links from that node to leaf node. Height of a binary tree is height of its root node. |

### Types of Binary Trees

**Strictly binary tree**: If every non-leaf node in a binary tree has nonempty left and right sub-trees, the tree is termed a strictly binary tree. Thus, the tree shown in Figure 7-3(a) is a strictly binary tree.

**Complete binary tree**: A complete binary tree (refer Figure 7-3(b)) has maximum number of possible nodes at all levels except the last level, and all the nodes of the last level appear as far left as possible.

![Figure 7-3: Strictly and Complete binary tree](image-placeholder)

## Representation of Binary Trees in Memory

There are two ways by which we can represent a binary tree—**Linked representation** and **Array representation**.

### Linked Representation of Binary Trees

In linked representation each node contains addresses of its left child and right child. If a child is absent, the link contains a NULL value. For example, in Figure 7-4 the link fields of node C contain the address of the nodes F and G. The left link field of node E contains the address of the node H. Similarly, the right link contains a NULL as E has no right child. The nodes D, F, G and H contain a NULL value in both their link fields, as these are the leaf nodes.

![Figure 7-4: Linked representation of a Binary tree](image-placeholder)

### Array Representation of Binary Trees

When a binary tree is represented by arrays three separate arrays are required. One array `arr` stores the data fields of the trees. The other two arrays `lc` and `rc` represents the left child and right child of the nodes. Figure 7-5 shows these three arrays, which represents the tree shown in Figure 7-4.

![Figure 7-5: Array representation of a binary tree](image-placeholder)

The arrays `lc` and `rc` contains the index of the array `arr` where the data is present. If the node does not have any left child or right child then the element of the array `lc` or `rc` contains a value -1. The 0th element of the array `arr` contains the root node data. Some elements of the array `arr` contain `'\0'` which represents an empty child.

Suppose we wish to find the left and right child of the node E. Then we need to find the value present at index 4 in array `lc` and `rc` since E is present at index 4 in the array `arr`. The value present at index 4 in the array `lc` is 9, which is the index position of node H in the array `arr`. So, the left child of the node E is H. The right child of the node E is empty because the value present at index 4 in the array `rc` is –1.

We can also represent a binary tree using **one single array**. For this, numbers are given to each node starting from the root node—0 to root node, 1 to the left node of the first level, then 2 to the second node from left of the first level and so on. In other words, the nodes are numbered from left to right level by level from top to bottom. Figure 7-6(a) shows the numbers given to each node in the tree. Note that while numbering the nodes of the tree, empty nodes are also taken into account.

![Figure 7-6: Array representation of binary tree using one array](image-placeholder)

It can be observed that if n is the number given to the node, then its left child is at position **(2n+1)** in the array and right child at position **(2n+2)**. If any node doesn't have a left or a right child then an empty node is assumed and a value `'\0'` is stored at that index in the array.

---

## Binary Search Trees

**Binary search tree (BST)** is a variant of binary tree in which the nodes are arranged in a particular manner. A BST has the property that **all the elements in the left sub-tree of a node n are less than n and all the elements in the right sub-tree of n are greater than or equal to n**. Figure 7-7 shows a few sample BSTs.

![Figure 7-7: Sample BSTs](image-placeholder)

---

## Operations on a Binary Search Tree

There are many operations that can be performed on binary search trees. **Insertion, Traversal, Searching and Deletion** are the most basic amongst them.

### Insertion of a Node

While inserting a node in a BST the value being inserted is compared with the root node. A left sub-tree is taken if the value is smaller than the root node and a right sub-tree if it is greater or equal to the node. This operation is repeated at each level till a node is found whose left or right sub-tree is empty. Finally, the new node is appropriately made the left or right child of this node.

If the input list is 3, 9, 1, 4, 7, 11, then Figure 7-8 shows the stepwise insertion of new nodes in a BST.

![Figure 7-8: Creation of a Binary Search Tree](image-placeholder)

### Traversal of a BST

The traversal of a BST is to visit each node in the tree exactly once. There are three popular methods of BST traversal:

| Traversal | Order of Operations |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Pre-order** | (1) Visit the root <br> (2) Traverse the left sub-tree in pre-order <br> (3) Traverse the right sub-tree in pre-order |
| **In-order** | (1) Traverse the left sub-tree in in-order <br> (2) Visit the root <br> (3) Traverse the right sub-tree in in-order |
| **Post-order** | (1) Traverse the left sub-tree in post-order <br> (2) Traverse the right sub-tree in post-order <br> (3) Visit the root |

In each of these methods nothing needs be done to traverse an empty BST.

![Figure 7-9: Traversals of binary tree](image-placeholder)

**Example from Figure 7-9:**
- Inorder: 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 17, 18, 20
- Preorder: 20, 17, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 13, 18
- Postorder: 5, 7, 13, 10, 8, 6, 18, 17, 20

### Searching of a Node

To search any node in a binary tree, initially the value to be searched is compared with the root node. If they match then the search is successful. If the value is greater than the root node then searching process proceeds in the right sub-tree of the root node, otherwise, it proceeds in the left sub-tree of the root node.

BST search operation is very efficient because while searching an element we do not need to traverse the entire tree. At every node, we get a hint regarding which sub-tree to search in. Since at every step we eliminate half of the sub-tree from the search process the **average search time is O(log₂n)**. Same applies to insertion or deletion of an element in a BST.

As against this, in a sorted array, even though searching can be done in O(log₂n) time, insertion and deletion times are high. In contrast, insertion and deletion of elements in a linked list is easier, but searching takes O(n).

Due to this efficiency BSTs are widely used in dictionary problems where insertion, deletion and search are done on the basis of some indexed key.

### Deletion of a Node

While deleting a node from a BST there are four possible cases that we need to consider:

**Case (a): Node to be deleted is not found**
If on traversing the BST the node is not found then we merely need to display the message that the node is not found.

**Case (b): Node to be deleted has no children**
In this case since the node to be deleted has no children the memory occupied by it should be freed and either the left link or the right link of the parent of this node should be set to NULL. Which link should be set to NULL depends upon whether the node being deleted is a left child or a right child of its parent.

**Case (c): Node to be deleted has one child**
In this case we have to adjust the pointer of the parent of the node to be deleted such that after deletion it points to the child of the node being deleted.

![Figure 7-10: Deletion of a node that has only one child](image-placeholder)

**Case (d): Node to be deleted has two children**
This is a more complex case. Consider node 23 shown in Figure 7-11(a). The **in-order successor** of the node 23 is node 45. The in-order successor should now be copied into the node to be deleted and a pointer should be set up pointing to the in-order successor (node 45). The in-order successor would always have one or zero child. This in-order successor should then be deleted using the same procedure as for deleting a one child or a zero-child node.

## Reconstruction of a Binary Tree

If we know the sequence of nodes obtained through in-order/preorder/post-order traversal it may not be feasible to reconstruct the binary tree. This is because two different binary trees may yield same sequence of nodes when traversed using post-order traversal. Similarly, in-order or pre-order traversal of different binary trees may yield the same sequence of nodes.

However, **we can construct a unique binary tree if the results of in-order and pre-order traversal are available.**

**Example:**
- In-order traversal: 4, 7, 2, 8, 5, 1, 6, 9, 3
- Pre-order traversal: 1, 2, 4, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9

We know that the first value in the pre-order traversal gives us the root of the binary tree. So, the node with data **1** becomes the root of the binary tree. In in-order traversal, initially the left sub-tree is traversed then the root node and then the right sub-tree. So, the data before 1 in the in-order list (i.e. 4, 7, 2, 8, 5) forms the left sub-tree and the data after 1 in the in-order list (i.e. 6, 9, 3) forms the right sub-tree.

![Figure 7-12: Reconstruction of a binary tree](image-placeholder)

## Threaded Binary Tree

In the linked representation of a binary tree, many nodes contain a NULL pointer, either in their left or right fields or in both. Instead of wasting space in storing a NULL pointer, it can be efficiently used to store pointer to the **in-order predecessor** or the **in-order successor** of the node. These special pointers are called **threads** and binary trees containing threads are called **threaded binary trees**.

In threaded binary trees:
- **Right threads**: pointers that point to in-order successor of a node
- **Left threads**: pointers that point to in-order predecessor of a node

The threads are typically denoted using arrows as shown in Figure 7-13.

![Figure 7-13: Threaded binary tree](image-placeholder)

Figure 7-13(b) shows a **head node** containing a value -999. The entire binary tree is shown as the left child of this head node. The right link of the head node points to itself. This head node is useful while creating programs for threaded binary tree. For example, while traversing the tree we can start with head node, visit each node and stop the traversal when we reach the head node once again.

In a program to help us distinguish between a pointer and a thread, the structure that represents a node contains two additional fields, `leftflag` and `rightflag`. If they contain a true, they represent a thread, and if they contain a false, then they represent a pointer to a child node.

```c
struct thtree {
    enum boolean leftflag;
    struct thtree *left;
    int data;
    struct thtree *right;
    enum boolean rightflag;
};
```

## AVL Trees

We know that height of a BST is the maximum number of edges from leaf node to root node. Note that if we change the order of insertion of nodes in a BST, we may get BSTs of different heights. Also, search time in a BST depends upon its height. Searching is efficient if the heights of both left and right sub-trees of any node are equal. However, frequent insertions and deletions in a BST are likely to make it unbalanced.

The efficiency of searching is ideal if the difference between the heights of left and right sub-trees of all the nodes in a BST is at the most one. Such a binary search tree is called a **Balanced BST**. It was invented in the year 1962 by two Russian mathematicians—**G.M. Adelson-Velskii and E.M. Landis**. Hence such trees are also known as **AVL trees**.

![Figure 7-15: AVL trees](image-placeholder)

The **balance factor** of a node is calculated as:
> **Balance Factor = height of left sub-tree - height of right sub-tree**

The balance factor of any node in an AVL BST should be **-1, 0, or 1**. If it is other than these three values then the tree is not balanced.

To re-balance and make it an AVL tree the nodes need to be properly adjusted. This is done by doing one of the **4 types of rotations**:

| Rotation | Type | Process |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Left rotation** | 1-step | For RR imbalance |
| **Right rotation** | 1-step | For LL imbalance |
| **Left-Right rotation** | 2-step | For LR imbalance |
| **Right-Left rotation** | 2-step | For RL imbalance |

![Figure 7-16: LL, RR, LR and RL imbalances and rotations](image-placeholder)

### Steps for Insertion in AVL BST:

1. **Step 1**: Calculate balance factors of all nodes
2. **Step 2**: Identify type of imbalance
3. **Step 3**: Perform rotation(s)

## Binary Heap

**Binary heap** is a **complete binary tree**. It means all its levels are completely filled except perhaps last and at the last level nodes are as much to left as possible.

There are two types of heaps:

| Type | Property |
|------|----------|
| **Max heap** (descending heap) | Value at any node is **greater** than all its children |
| **Min heap** (ascending heap) | Value at any node is **smaller** than all its children |

![Figure 7-17: Types of heaps](image-placeholder)

### Heapify Operation

One of the common operations carried out while using a binary heap is **heapification** of a node. While heapifying a node in a max heap, we need to ensure that all its children satisfy the heap property—**Parent >= Left child, Right child**.

**Steps:**
1. Pick maximum out of given node, and its left and right child
2. If maximum is root, do nothing
3. If maximum is left, exchange root with left and heapify left node
4. If maximum is right, exchange root with right and heapify right node

### Program 7-3: Construction of max heap

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void heapify(int [], int, int);

int main() {
    int arr[] = {11, 2, 9, 13, 3, 25, 17, 1, 90, 57};
    int i, size;
    size = 10;
    
    for (i = size / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        heapify(arr, size, i);
    
    for (i = 0; i < size; i++)
        printf("%d\t", arr[i]);
}

void heapify(int arr[], int sz, int i) {
    int largest, lch, rch, t;
    lch = 2 * i + 1;
    rch = 2 * i + 2;
    
    if (lch >= sz)
        return;
    
    largest = i;
    
    /* if left child is larger than root */
    if (lch < sz && arr[lch] > arr[largest])
        largest = lch;
    
    /* if right child is larger than largest so far */
    if (rch < sz && arr[rch] > arr[largest])
        largest = rch;
    
    /* if largest is not root */
    if (largest != i) {
        t = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[largest];
        arr[largest] = t;
        /* heapify the affected sub-tree */
        heapify(arr, sz, largest);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
90	57	25	13	11	9	17	1	2	3	
```

On execution of the program the binary tree shown in Figure 7-20(a) gets converted into a max heap shown in Figure 7-20(b).
